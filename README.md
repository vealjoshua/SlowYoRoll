"# SlowYoRoll" 
Enter in the size of the grid and how many times you want the program to run.
A random number generator will pick a number 1-4.
A marker will move left, right, up, or down along an invisible grid depending on the number randomly chosen.
When the marker reaches the upper right corner of the grid, the simulation ends. Data is then displayed.
The bottom left corner of the grid starts with 1 step.
